# Peer-to-Peer Distributed File Sharing System

This project implements a **group-based peer-to-peer distributed file sharing system** using C++ and system calls. The system consists of **clients** and **synchronized trackers**, supporting multi-peer parallel downloads, user and group management, and SHA1-based integrity checks.

---

## üìã Features

### ‚úÖ Core Functionalities

* Two synchronized trackers
* User account creation & login (with basic authentication)
* Group creation and management (owner-based model)
* Group membership request and approval system
* File sharing (SHA1 based piecewise metadata)
* List available groups and files
* Parallel **multi-peer downloading** with custom **piece selection algorithm**
* File integrity verification (SHA1 hash comparison)
* Download progress monitoring
* Persistent file sharing across login sessions
* Logout disables sharing (until next login)

---

## üß± Prerequisites

* C++11 compiler
* OpenSSL library (for SHA1 hashing)
* Linux OS (uses POSIX system calls)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Compilation

Use `make` or compile manually as follows:

### Tracker

```bash
g++ tracker.cpp -o tracker
```

### Client

```bash
g++ client.cpp -o client -lssl -lcrypto
```

> **Note**: OpenSSL is used only for SHA1 hashing. `-lssl -lcrypto` are necessary.

---

## üöÄ Running the Application

### üñ•Ô∏è Tracker

Start each tracker:

```bash
./tracker tracker_info.txt <tracker_no>
```

* `tracker_info.txt`: Contains IP and port of all trackers (one per line)
* `<tracker_no>`: 0-based index into the tracker list (e.g., 0 for the first one)

Example:

```bash
./tracker tracker_info.txt 0
```

### üíª Client

```bash
./client <IP>:<PORT> tracker_info.txt
```

Example:

```bash
./client 127.0.0.1:10000 tracker_info.txt
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Highlights

* **Multi-threading**: Separate threads for communication, uploads, downloads.
* **Tracker Synchronization**: Trackers sync on user data, group info, file metadata.
* **File Division**: Files are split into **512KB** pieces.
* **SHA1 Hashing**:

  * For full file integrity check
  * For each 512KB piece (stored with tracker)
* **Piece Selection Algorithm**:

  * Prefer downloading different pieces from different peers
  * Fallback to other peers if any disconnects
* **Persistence**:

  * Shared files are automatically re-shared upon next login
* **Session Control**:

  * Logout halts sharing
  * Login resumes all previous file sharing states

## üóÇ File Structure

> **Note:** No extra folders should be present outside `tracker/` and `client/`.

---

## ‚ùó Assumptions

* At least one tracker is always online.
* Clients reconnect automatically to alternate tracker if primary fails.
* `Single-threaded` tracker; `multi-threaded client`.
* Shared files are not physically copied to tracker‚Äîonly metadata is.
* Only system calls are used. No banned libraries (like `filesystem`, `exec`, `system()`).
* Every client runs on a `fixed (static) IP and port` that does not change across restarts/logins.

---

## üìå Limitations

* Communication is in plaintext (no encryption over sockets).
* Passwords stored/compared in plain form.
* No GUI; entirely command-line interface.

---

## üìö References

* Linux `socket()`, `bind()`, `listen()`, `accept()`, `send()`, `recv()` system calls
* SHA1 hashing using OpenSSL (`SHA1()` API)
* Threading via POSIX `pthread` API
